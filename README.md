A quick Python script you can use to convert .wav files to .flac automatically.
Can search through and convert entire directories (I'm primarily using this to transfer drives, so just tweak the directories if you just want folders, etc.).
Working on adding in a function to update and look for missing files in directories.
Runs using ffmpeg, so you should have that installed: https://ffmpeg.org/ .
Added a json file to change the drives so you don't have to bother going into the script and doing it.
